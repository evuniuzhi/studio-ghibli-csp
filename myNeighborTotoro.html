    <h1>My Neighbor Totoro</h1>
    <p>On a warm day, 10 year old Satsuki and 4 year old Mei drive with their father, Tatsuo, to a rural area where their new home is located which is close to a hospital their mother is staying in. The house is falling apart, but the girls find it charming and start exploring the house. They discover black soot balls and catch one, bringing it to Granny, an old woman helping the family move in. She explains that these “soot spirits” are susuwatari that disappear once people conquer their fear of the spirits. </p>

    <p>Later that night, the house creaks from the wind, causing the girls to be anxious, but the father encourages them to laugh, saying that it will cause spirits to disperse. Sure enough, as soon as the family laughs together, the clan of susuwatari leaves the house and drifts away in the wind.</p>

    <p>The next morning, Satsuki goes to school and Tatsuo, a professor, stays in his study to work, leaving Mei to wander around the garden freely. Mei notices two white, rabbit-like ears poking out from the grass and watches the small, semi-transparent creature walk towards the house. She runs off until it hides under the porch and later emerges with a larger spirit with a bag full of acorns. Mei follows the trail of acorns the blue creature leaves behind into a nearby forest with a large camphor tree. She climbs into the tree and falls onto the stomach of Totoro which Mei falls asleep on. </p>

    <p>Satsuki arrives home and notices her sister missing. She and her father search for her until Satsuki finds Mei’s hat on the edge of the forest. Following the same path Mei took, Satsuki and her father find her sleeping in a clearing within the bushes. Confused, Mei tries to retrace her steps back to the tree where she found Totoro. When she becomes upset that she can't find it again, Tatsuo explains that she must have come into contact with a spirit of the forest who probably doesn't want to be found right now.</p>

    <p>That afternoon, the family takes a bike ride further into town to see the girls' mother. They pass Granny and Kanta working in rice paddies, and Kanta and Satsuki blow raspberries at each other. At the hospital, the girls tell their mother how wonderful the new house is, and Mei brags that when Yasuko is well enough to come home she will sleep with her in her bed.</p>

    <p>One day at school, Satsuki is surprised to see Mei and Granny waiting for her outside. Although Mei was given into Granny's care that day while Tatsuo went to university, she wants to be with no one but Satsuki. Satsuki agrees to let Mei stay in school with her, with the teacher's permission. As they walk home that afternoon, a rainstorm comes upon them unexpectedly. Satsuki and Mei take shelter under the roof of a small shrine until Kanta approaches and silently offers them his umbrella, though he does so with a little abrasiveness to hide his kindness. Satsuki and Mei later return the umbrella to Kanta's mother and walk to the bus station to wait for their father.</p>

    <p>While the sisters wait in their rain gear, with an extra umbrella, Mei grows tired and Satsuki places her on her back to sleep. Satsuki suddenly sees two clawed feet stand next to her. She looks up to see none other than Totoro waiting beside her. When she sees that he has nothing to shelter him from the rain but a large leaf, she offers him the extra umbrella. Pleased with the shelter and the noise the raindrops make on the umbrella, Totoro roars with joy as headlights appear down the dark road. Satsuki becomes puzzled when the headlights start to bounce. A bus does appear, but one that is mainly a large cat. Catbus grins widely at them as Totoro hands Satsuki a leaf-wrapped package before getting on and departing. Tatsuo arrives on the regular bus, apologizing that he ran late. The girls walk home with him and open their package to find that it's filled with acorns. They go outside to the garden and plant them.</p>

    <p>That night, Satsuki and Mei are awakened by sounds outside and discover Totoro and his company of smaller totoros walking around the garden in a procession. They join them outside and mimic their dancing to encourage the acorns to grow. Saplings spring up and quickly grow larger before merging into one giant tree. As the girls cheer, Totoro pulls out a large, spinning top and stands on it. The girls cling to the fur on his belly and he flies into the air, up the trunk of the tree. They sit on the high branches together, making music with hollow gourds.</p>

    <p>The next morning, the girls wake up to find the tree gone. However, they notice that the seeds they planted have already started to sprout.</p>

    <p>During one afternoon, the girls enjoy a picnic with Granny, who has prepared a fresh meal of vegetables grown from her garden. She tells them that fresh vegetables will help their mother get better. A telegram arrives for Tatsuo from the hospital. Worried for her mother, Satsuki rushes to Kanta's house to phone her father. After contacting the hospital, he calls her back to say her mother is fine, but won't be able to come home that weekend due to a set-back in her treatment. Despite his assurances, Satsuki takes the news hard and yells at Mei when she fails to understand why their mother can't come home. Granny explains to Satsuki that their mother should be fine but Satsuki begins to cry and fears that her mother will die. Mei sees this and decides to go to the hospital to give her mother an ear of corn so that she will feel better.</p>

    <p>By the time Satsuki notices that Mei is missing, she is long gone. The entire neighborhood pitches in to search for her while Satsuki runs everywhere, remorseful for having yelled at her. One tense moment yields to relief when Satsuki identifies a shoe found in a nearby pond as not belonging to Mei. Still desperate to find Mei, Satsuki runs home and asks permission to enter Totoro's realm. She finds the hole in the roots where Mei fell in and stumbles upon Totoro. She tearfully begs him to help her find Mei. Happy to be of assistance, Totoro takes Satsuki to the top of his tree and summons Catbus, who takes her straight to Mei, sitting alone by the side of the road. After hearing that Mei got lost on the way to the hospital, Catbus offers to take them there.</p>

    <p>The Catbus finds Mei and brings her and her sister to their mother’s hospital to reassure them. Perched in a tree outside their mother's window, the girls see their father visiting. They leave Mei's corn on the windowsill and write a get-well message on the husk. Catbus takes them home. </p>

    <p>The end credits show Mei's and Satsuki's mother finally coming home, with scenes of the children playing with friends while Totoro and the other spirits watch them, unseen.
